## Step 1: Start a Skeleton CMake Project from a Template

Commit: **TODO**

The CMake skeleton was adapted from [a very helpful and educative blog](https://mjmorse.com/blog/cmake-template/).

For now there isn't any non-trivial adaptation: we simply replace their project name "CMakeDemo" with our "SmartHome" and remove those cmake lines about INSTALL.
